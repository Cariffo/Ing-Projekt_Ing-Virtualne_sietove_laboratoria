Linux installation from source
Created by Jason Neumann

Before starting, be sure to download the latest GNS3 source code from gns3.com. This will ensure that you have the latest features, and bug fixes. After downloading the source code you're ready to begin.

Step 1: Update Your Linux Source Files and Install GNS3 Dependencies

sudo apt-get update
Now install the development version of python3, install pyqt5, and other dependencies required to install and run GNS3. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/N3y5F-nROPc
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsvg
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit
sudo apt‐get install python3‐ws4py
sudo apt‐get install python3‐netifaces
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Step 2: Install the software required by dynamips. 
Install Dependencies Required to Compile Dynamips
The dynamips hypervisor is a program that emulates Cisco MIPS based router hardware, allowing you to run select IOS image files in GNS3. Using dynamips you can run IOS images for Cisco c1700, c2600, c3600, 3700, and 7200 series routers. You must provide your own IOS image files, as GNS3 is unable to provide them. Start by installing the libraries and tools required to compile dynamips. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/Po8ncDr5egA
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt‐get install uuid‐dev
sudo apt‐get install libelf‐dev
sudo apt‐get install libpcap‐dev
After installing the libraries, and other software, you're ready to compile and install the dynamips program.


Step 3: Compile the Dynamips Hypervisor
Much of the software that you'll install for GNS3, including dynamips, requires you to compile it from source code. If you are new to Linux or have never compiled software before, don't worry it's fairly straight forward. 
You'll need to go to your Linux Downloads folder (or wherever you saved your source code) and unzip the GNS3 source code file. This will extract other zip files that will also be unzipped and used to install your GNS3 system. 
Use the cd (change directory) command to change to your Downloads directory, use the ls command to list files in a directory, and use the unzip command to extract the contents of a zip file. Be sure to substitute  “GNS3-1.4.0rc1.source.zip” with the name of the file you downloaded. This video Shows you how: https://youtu.be/IT0IyGgQbWE

Step 4: Complete these commands at a terminal:
cd Downloads
ls
GNS3-1.4.0rc1.source.zip
unzip GNS3-1.4.0rc1.source.zip
This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/Rcmob9Ecm7M


Step 5:Enter the following commands to compile, and install dynamips.
unzip dynamips-0.2.14.zip
cd dynamips-0.2.14
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=ep /usr/local/bin/dynamips
cd ../..

Now that dynamips is installed you're ready to move on to the GNS3 server and GUI applications. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/TfutI5NNFps

Step 6: Install the GNS3 Server and GUI Applications
The GNS3 software is made up of two main components; a server application, and a GUI application. This provides a great amount of flexibility by allowing you to run multiple servers on different PCs. Leveraging this feature, you can create large GNS3 networks. Start by unzipping and installing the GNS3 server application.
unzip GNS3-server-1.4.0rc1.zip (remember to substitute with the actual file you downloaded)
cd GNS3-server-1.4.0rc1
sudo python3 setup.py install
cd ..
Next, install the GNS3 GUI application.
unzip GNS3-gui-1.4.0rc1.zip
cd GNS3-gui-1.4.0rc1
sudo python3 setup.py install
cd ..
Note: The GNS3 installer downloads other files required to build the GNS3 server and GUI. If you see errors during the install process, they're usually caused because the installer was unable to download a required file. Re-running the sudo python3 setup.py install command often resolves this issue. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/q8_mCLxZpDk

Step 7: After installing the GNS3 server and GUI, install IOS on UNIX (IOU) related files.
Install IOU Dependencies
Installing the IOU dependencies allows you to run Cisco IOS on UNIX binary images in GNS3. IOU images are Linux binary files that emulate the features of Cisco IOS L2 and L3 devices, and are a handy way to create switches, and use advanced IOS 15.x features that are not available in most of the IOS images that run under dynamips. You must provide your own IOU image files, as GNS3 is unable to provide them. Enter the following commands to install the IOU dependencies. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/wqlJgAOFYPc
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0:i386
sudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 /lib/libcrypto.so.4
sudo apt-get install bison
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install git
git clone http://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser.git
cd iniparser
make
sudo cp libiniparser.* /usr/lib/
sudo cp src/iniparser.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp src/dictionary.h /usr/local/include
cd .. 
After installing the IOU dependencies you can compile the iouyap application. 

Step 8: Compile and Install IOUYAP
IOU devices can be networked to other device in GNS3. The iouyap program provides the ability to add IOU devices to your GNS3 workspace and link their Ethernet interfaces to other devices, like dynamips routers. The following commands will compile and install iouyap. 
unzip iouyap-0.95.zip
cd iouyap-0.95
sudo make install
sudo cp iouyap /usr/local/bin
cd ..
After installing iouyap, install the ubridge application. This video shows you how: https://youtu.be/rHIgRK0Sb0M

Step 9: Install other supporting software; Cpulimit, Virtualbox, QEMU and Wireshark.
The cpulimit application allows GNS3 to reduce CPU usage when running Cisco ASA devices in GNS3. With VirtualBox installed you can link emulated VirtualBox devices with other GNS3 devices. QEMU (Quick Emulator) is another PC hypervisor, and it is used to create and run Cisco ASA and other devices in GNS3. Wireshark is a powerful packet analyzer; using Wireshark you can sniff packets from your virtual GNS3 networks and analyze them, just as you can in the real world. Enter the following commands to complete your installation. This video shows you how:https://youtu.be/p-IgXoSw_CU
sudo apt-get install cpulimit
sudo apt-get install virtualbox
sudo apt-get install qemu
sudo apt-get install wireshark

Step 10: Compile and Install VPCS
VPCS is a simple but powerful little PC emulator that allows you to test your GNS3 networks using commands like ping and trace. Enter the following commands to compile and install VPCS.
unzip vpcs-0.6.1.zip
cd vpcs-0.6.1/src
./mk.sh
sudo cp vpcs /usr/local/bin/
cd ../..
Complete the installation process by installing cpulimit, VirtualBox, QEMU, and Wireshark.

Step 11: Install the Ubridge and other gns3 software.
Ubridge is a program used to bridge GNS3 devices to virtual machines running in VMware. Enter these commands to compile and install the ubridge application.
unzip ubridge-0.9.0.zip
cd ubridge-0.9.0
make
sudo make install
cd ..

Step 12: run gns3 in a terminal window.
gns3
You will now be presented with the GNS3 GUI, and a setup wizard to help get you started.
Note: No videos for this step.

Optional Step 13: Upgrading GNS3
You may have an occasion to upgrade GNS3. Use the following commands to upgrade the GNS3 server and GUI applications. In the following example, I'm upgrading to GNS3 version 1.4.5. When entering the commands, replace “1.4.5” with the version you wish to upgrade to. It's important to note that your server and GUI applications must both be on the same version number.
sudo pip3 install gns3-gui==1.4.5
sudo pip3 install gns3-server==1.4.5
To learn how to use GNS3 effectively, we encourage you to read our other GNS3 user documentation. We believe a strong community helps to create a better product, so we also invite you to join our GNS3 forums. Using the forums you can contribute to the community by asking questions, posting replies to other peoples questions, and providing feedback about GNS3. Have Fun!
